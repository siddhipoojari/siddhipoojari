# 👋 Hi there! I'm Siddhi Poojari

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m a passionate Data Science and Analytics student at the University of Texas at Austin, where I also work as a Teaching Assistant for Database Management Systems at the iSchool. My experience as a full-stack developer at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) made me well-versed in Angular and Spring MVC, and gave me the opportunity to collaborate with diverse teams to deliver products. 
I love transforming complex data into meaningful insights through innovative, data-driven solutions.
